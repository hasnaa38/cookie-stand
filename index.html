        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            One night in Seattle, Pat Benson; the author of Professional Baking, has come up with an idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a salmon that has just a hint of fishy goodness.
            <br>Later on, he decided to take his idea and turn it a business by selling them on a small cookie stand in Seattle. Today, Pat's Salmon Cookies became globally known and can be found in stores located in five different cities around the world.
